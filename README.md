# Lecture 14: Morphing and Animation

Detailed explanation of this code can be found in the lecture video (will be added after class).

You can run the program on [GitHub pages](https://csci-4611-fall-2022.github.io/Lecture-14).

## Prerequisites

To work with this code, you will first need to install [Node.js 16.17.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

## Topics

- Finishing Lecture 13 morphing code
- Morphing with character models
- Using lerp() functions

## Running

You will need to set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from the node package manager with:

```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:

```
npm run start
```

Webpack should launch your program in a web browser automatically.  If not, you can run it by pointing your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
